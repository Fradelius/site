## Stand out

The best of all luxuries of working remotely for a European/US startup is that you get a chance to work with the big brains. Big brains in the sense that these people compete from all around the world to get the job. They are from diverse backgrounds. Someone could be from Harvard, other one could be from MIT. When all of the brains sit together to get a task done, the interaction is very fascinating.

It's different to what we have in the Pakistani offices. I worked for around 1.5 years for 3 companies ([see resume](/resume)) in pakistan and I realise its almost the same evironment with known people there. In remote jobs, I feel excited to know about cultures and regions from the globe and it feels great to be part of the greater world.

I see remote jobs as a challenge and an opportunity for Pakistanis to stand out in their career. This increases your network and gives you more exposure than anything else.

## Growth

When I started working remotely, or when I was about to accept an offer for a remote job, I always got this advise from seniors that "don't accept the offer because you'll become stagnant". "There's no interaction in the remote jobs so you'll learn less". "Remote jobs are temporary only". "They are offering you because you live in a cheap country."

After one year of my successful career as a remote software engineer, I can tell you that these are all bulls*it advises. 

The most important thing for anyone to grow is **feedback** and you can get it from anywhere. Getting feedback has nothing to do with whether you work remotely or from office. Software engineers usually rely on code reviews and my code reviews were extremely brutal. I always had like 30 comments on 3 lines of codes in my merge requests. 

My first mentor in the company was [Yann Buydens](https://yannbuy.com/), who is the co-founder and was the CTO of the company. He not only gave me thorough reviews on my merge requests, but also advises that will remain with me till the end of my life. He literally gave feedback to me on what to speak in meetings, how to think efficiently and how to write good content. He added composure in my thinking and gave me confidence that I didn't know I have.

My second mentor in the company was Etienne Bomcke who is tech lead of the company. He's very objective about everything and all the advises I got from him were super valuable and easy to follow. He does 1-on-1 meetings every two weeks and does complete retrospection of your performance like a psychologist. He even asks if I'm happy or not with the company and work that I do.

At least for me, the growth has been great. I've never felt the need for in-person meeting or work from office of any sorts.

## Salaries

When I started hunting for jobs during my last semester at the university, I realised there was this abundance of jobs in the job market which were giving 70,000PKR to 90,000PKR to top performers of the University. This equates to around USD400 to USD500 per month. A great offer meant 140,000PKR which is also less than a thousand dollars. 

I was sceptical about these jobs since the start and when I started looking at the international market, I got the notion that we are getting insultingly underpaid jobs and we are among the most talented people in the world. The university where I studied is the premium computer science university in the country. I thought, maybe this is meant to be this way. But seeing how Indian software engineers are getting about at least 10 times more salary than an average software engineer in Pakistan, my scepticism amplfied by 10x.

I always thought getting 100K per month should be the dream of every Pakistani engineer out there in the job market. But I was wrong. The amount is way more than that.

I watched an Indian guy explaining this in a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbZK-tNHXW4) that he was able to cover all his four-year tuition fee in a single paycheck. SINGLE PAYCHECK! If this isn't an eye-openner for you, then what is? 

The salaries for a junior software developer in any startup in the European or US region is at least USD40,000 which equates to around 5 lacs PKR per month. And this is just for a junior developer, if you grow, you'll get equity, bonuses, increments and lots and lots of incentives.
