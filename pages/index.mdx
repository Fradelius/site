# Mohsin Hayat

Hey, I'm a passionate full stack web developer with extensive experience in frontend, backend, automation and scaling of multiple web applications. 

I currently work remotely as a Software Engineer at Awell Health. I've two years of professional experience and about three years of freelancing experience on multiple platforms. I've won programming competitions, got distinctions in my BSCS degree and I've been top rated on Upwork.

I love problem solving and I love working on TypeScript + NodeJS.
